Chances are, it feels a little out of date. You probably can't even read its content on your phone without lots of pinching and zooming. 

Crazy right? It's the virtual front door of the campus. This website needs to attract and inform current and prospective students, their families, alumni, professors, and donors. It has to be user-friendly, convey value to different personas, and guide visitors to other parts of the site. Oh, and it should also be visually pleasing. 

The good news is that not all colleges have this problem. There are quite a few schools with beautiful, helpful, and intuitive websites -- you just have to know where to look. 

So we decided to showcase the best of the best U.S. college websites below. Check them out and learn what about their web design makes them so brilliant. (And if your alma mater is on the list, be sure to let us know!)</p>
